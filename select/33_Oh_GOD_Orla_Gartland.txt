I look at you and I know how I felt
All those summers ago, then I swore not to tell
I'm swallowed up whole by this catholic guilt
oh GOD
If I always do what I am told
I'll be bitter at fifty years old
I wasted my youth
I wasted my time
I wasted my worry on the little things
If you always just laugh it off
I won't be opening up
We kissed on the bed
It messed with my head
Does that mean nothing to you?
I look at you and I know how I felt
all those summers ago, then I swore not to tell
I'm swallowed up whole by this catholic guilt
I don't want to think about it
I don't want to think about it
I don't want to think about it
I don't want to think about it
I'm just trying to shake off the shame
When I'm wearing nothing but blame
Not easy cause when I close my eyes
I just think of touching you
This can't be easy on his side
Laying there motionless each night
A head full of heat, skin, sweat, sin
Tangled up feet and now clutching at sheets thinking
I look at her and I know how I felt
All those summers ago then I swore not to tell
I'm swallowed up by this catholic guilt
oh GOD
I don't want to think about it
I don't want to think about it
I don't want to think about it
I don't want to think about it
(I can't control it)
I don't want to think about it
