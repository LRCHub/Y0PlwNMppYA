I know it's been a while since I have talked to you
But maybe you're the one who makes the winds blow
We're looking at the stars without explanation
We contemplate as kings and simple men on trial
Our little world's fragile
Oh God can you tell us when it's going to stop
Maybe it's not just down to you
Oh God can we win back what we have lost
So who's the last resort, oh God
Tumbling towards unclear destinations
Do they wash away the pain,
The wind and the searing rains
As our powers interchange
Oh God can you tell us when it's going to stop
Maybe it's not just down to you
Oh God can we win back what we have lost
So who's the last resort, oh God
Oh God can you tell us when it's going to stop
Maybe it's not just down to you
Oh God can we win back what we have lost
So who's the last resort
