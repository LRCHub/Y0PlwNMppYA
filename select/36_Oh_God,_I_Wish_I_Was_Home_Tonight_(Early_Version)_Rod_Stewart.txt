The rain poured down the wind swept avenue
On another dark wet December afternoon
All my cherished memories are of you
All my warmth and comfort stayed with You

I would have wrote You a letter but the telephone calls are free
'Cause the boys in the next apartment are working all day
They're a great bunch of guys but I think they're all gay
What am I doing avoiding what I'm trying to say, hey

Oh God I wish I was home tonight with You in my arms
Oh God I wish I was home tonight

Send me a naked picture by the U.S. mail
Write a pornographic letter, You know I won't tell
Keep Your legs closed tight, keep Your body under lock and key
Stay home at night and save all the best parts for me, yeah baby

Oh God I wish I was home tonight, yes I do baby
Oh God I wish I was home tonight, oh

I could be home in time for Christmas if You want me to be
There's a plane leaves here at midnight arriving at three
But I'm a bit financially embarrassed I must admit
To tell You the truth my honey I haven't a cent but you know what

Oh God I wish I was home tonight, tonight baby
Oh God I wish I was home tonight

Guess I'd better ring off before the boys get home
My regards to all your family and everyone at home
There's a lump comes to my throat and a tear I can't hide
'Cause I want to see you so badly, I just may die
And you know why baby

Oh God I wish I was home tonight, with the I ones that I love
Oh God I wish I was home tonight, yeah
Oh God I wish I was home tonight
Oh my God I wish I was home tonight, tonight, tonight

I've been hearing voices out on the street
They say you've found some one else who's really quite neat
But he doesn't move you like I do
Tell me what I wanna hear that it just ain't true
