I've been sick of laying up in this bed you know
I've been laid up three days or more to ease my head
And the TV's always on by my side
And I can't get enough to turn it off, not even if I tried
For some strange reason I got out of my bed
And walked across the room
Looked in the mirror, what did I see?
I saw the Devil, he was looking at me
My oh my, boy am I wasted. yeah but you tasted good
Don't criticise, I know you can take it
I always knew that you would
My oh my boy am I wasted,
Mmm but you tasted fine
Cry oh cry tears can't erase it,
It's just a question of time
Yeah I'm sick of driving round in this car
I been 3000 miles or so and I still ain't got too far
And the radio's always on by my side
I can't get enough to turn it off, not even if I tried
For some strange reason I pulled over to the side
And started thinking about you
Looked in the mirror, what did I see?
I saw the Devil creeping up on me
My oh my, boy am I wasted. yeah but you tasted good
Don't criticise, I know you can take it
I always knew that you would
My oh my boy am I wasted,
Mmm but you tasted fine
Cry oh cry tears can't erase it,
It's just a question of time
My oh my boy am I wasted
Yeah but you tasted yummy, yummy so good
Cry oh cry tears can't erase it aah
Yummy yummy
My oh my, boy am I wasted
Yeah but you tasted so fine
Don't criticise, I know you can take it
I always knew that you would
