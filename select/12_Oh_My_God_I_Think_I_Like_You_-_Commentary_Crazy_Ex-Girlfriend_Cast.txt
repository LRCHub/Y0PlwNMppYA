You've been tearing me up for a week and a half
I don't mean, like, in my heart
I mean, physically, you've been tearin' me up
It's D-Day in my lady parts

But as I'm beggin' for more
Writhing around on the floor
I feel somethin' deep inside I never felt before...

Oh my god, I think I like you
Oh my god, I think I like you

It's scary, but you send me back on my heels
'Cause while I'm gettin' spanked, I can't ignore the feels

But I say, "No no no! This is just about sex!"
And "No no no! Don't be such a girl, Becks!"
But then I feel the oxytocin creeping back to my brain
And all I can do is sing it again
Oh my god, I think I like you

Why can't I just focus on gettin' a pounding
All the bidness goin' on in my thighs?
But as my body's getting ruined, like, really trashed
I only wanna look in your eyes

But then I'm upside-down next to my kitchen sink
And suddenly, it's like oh my god, I think...

I like you
Oh my god, I think I like you

My feelings get stronger every day
I'm like a little girl, not in a role-playing way

Are there condoms that can prevent these feelings?
Is there spermicidal lubricant that can kill
The fluttering in my heart?
Is there an IUD
That can stop the image of you and me
Getting married on a hillside, surrounded by ducks
And then we get into a rowboat?

Oh my god! I think I like you
Oh my god, I think I like you

But I say, "No no no"
No no no
No no no
