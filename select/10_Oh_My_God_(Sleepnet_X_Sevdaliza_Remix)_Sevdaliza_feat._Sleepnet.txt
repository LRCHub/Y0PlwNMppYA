Oh my God
Who should I be?
What is it you want when you come for me?
Every time you're another evil
Waiting for an angel that you bring to hell

O-o-oh my God
Who should I be?
What is it you want when you come for me?
Every time you're another evil
Waiting for an angel that you bring to hell
Oh my God
Who should I be?
What is it you want when you come for me?
Every time you're another evil
Waiting for an angel that you bring to hell

I've been through a lot in life
I li-i-i-ive u-u-up
Distant from it all
I view myse-elf from abo-o-ove
Roamin' in the fields of hope
Will it make or break me?
As my dreams are heavy
They outweigh you and me (Ichima, спасибо)

O-o-oh my God
Who should I be?
What is it you want when you come for me?
Every time you're another evil
Waiting for an angel that you bring to hell
Oh my God
Who should I be?
What is it you want when you come for me?
Every time you're another evil
Waiting for an angel that you bring to hell

True that you're not alone
True that you're not alone
(Will it make or break me?)
True that you're not alone
True that you're not alone

Oh my God
Who should I be?
What is it you want when you come for me?
Every time you're another evil
Waiting for an angel that you bring to hell
Oh my God
Who should I be?
What is it you want when you come for me?
Every time you're another evil
Waiting for an angel that you bring to hell
Oh my God
Who should I be?
What is it you want when you come for me?
Every time you're another evil

Roamin' in the fields of hope
Will it make or break me?
As my dreams are heavy
They outweigh you and me (Ichima, спасибо)
