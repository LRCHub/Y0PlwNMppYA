Oh, my stars
You should've seen it
From the sky
A piece of ice fell

On the walk
Where pigeons gather
At the time
They all departed

Sinking slow
The late sun found it
I kept still
I did not touch it
Oh, my stars
You should've seen it

In the den
While I sat reading
I did not see
The stranger watching

My dad chased
Him down the driveway
He could have killed him
He wished he killed him

Sirens wailed
Floodlights shined in
All the rooms
Of our house

Oh, my stars
You should've seen it
Hard and blue
White and brilliant
